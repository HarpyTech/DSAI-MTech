Ensemble techniques in machine learning combine predictions from **multiple models** to produce a **more robust and accurate** outcome than any individual model could achieve on its own.

---

## 🎯 Why Use Ensemble Techniques?

* Reduce **bias** (underfitting)
* Reduce **variance** (overfitting)
* Improve **accuracy**, **robustness**, and **generalization**

---

## 🧠 Types of Ensemble Techniques

### 1. ✅ **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**

> Trains multiple **independent models** on **random subsets** of data (with replacement) and combines them (usually via majority vote or average).

* **Goal**: Reduce **variance**
* **Best with**: High-variance models (e.g., decision trees)

📌 **Example Algorithms**:

* **Random Forest** = Bagging of Decision Trees
* **Bagged SVM / KNN / MLP**

---

### 2. ➕ **Boosting**

> Trains models **sequentially**, where each model **focuses on errors** made by previous models.

* **Goal**: Reduce **bias**
* **Best with**: Weak learners (e.g., shallow trees)

📌 **Popular Boosting Algorithms**:

* **AdaBoost** (Adaptive Boosting)
* **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**
* **XGBoost**
* **LightGBM**
* **CatBoost**

---

### 3. 🎯 **Stacking (Stacked Generalization)**

> Combines predictions from **multiple base learners** using a **meta-model** (or blender) that learns how to best combine them.

* **Base models**: Can be different (e.g., XGBoost, SVM, Neural Net)
* **Meta-model**: Often Logistic Regression, XGBoost, etc.

📌 Useful when base models are diverse.

---

### 4. 🗳️ **Voting Ensemble**

> Combines predictions from multiple models using **voting**.

* **Hard Voting**: Takes the most frequent class (majority rule)
* **Soft Voting**: Averages predicted probabilities (more stable)

📌 Best when:

* All models are trained independently
* You want simple ensemble logic

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier

ensemble = VotingClassifier(
    estimators=[('lr', logistic), ('rf', random_forest), ('svc', svc)],
    voting='soft'  # or 'hard'
)
```

---

### 5. 🧪 **Blending**

> Similar to stacking, but uses a **holdout set** (instead of cross-validation) to train the meta-model.

📌 Simpler than stacking, but less robust.

---

## 🧬 Hybrid Ensemble (e.g., DL + XGBoost)

* Combine **deep learning models** (e.g., Keras) with **tree-based models** (e.g., XGBoost).
* Average or stack predictions.
* Often boosts performance on structured + unstructured features.
