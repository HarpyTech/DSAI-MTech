    "<u>**The Problem Statement**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract is made up of different sections, one of them being the large bowel. Several types of anomalies and diseases can affect the large bowel, such as colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer type among women and third most common among men. Polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, and is found in nearly half of the individuals at age 50 having a screening colonoscopy, and are increasing with age. Colonoscopy is the gold standard for detection and assessment of these polyps with subsequent biopsy and removal of the polyps. Early disease detection has a huge impact on survival from colorectal cancer, and polyp detection is therefore important. In addition, several studies have shown that polyps are often overlooked during colonoscopies, with polyp miss rates of 14%-30% depending on the type and size of the polyps. Increasing the detection of polyps has been shown to decrease risk of colorectal cancer. Thus, automatic detection of more polyps at an early stage can play a crucial role in improving both prevention of and survival from colorectal cancer.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 247 polyp images and their corresponding masks.The resolution of the images varies from 332x487 to 1920x1072 pixels. The images and its corresponding masks are stored in two separate folders. Find the dataset under the folder **“polyp_segmentation_dataset”**.\n",

    "Develop a Semantic segmentation model using Unet architecture on the given dataset.\n",

    "6. Compile with appropriate loss and metric and fit the data into it.\n",
