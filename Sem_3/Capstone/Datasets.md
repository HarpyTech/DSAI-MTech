## üè• Overview of Clinical Datasets for Agentic AI and CDSS Applications

Below is a concise summary of four healthcare-related datasets, all well-suited for building **Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS)** or **Agentic AI models** on GCP and Gemini. Each dataset provides structured clinical or diagnostic data valuable for predictive modeling, classification, or personalized medical decision-making.

### ü´Ä 1. [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oktayrdeki/heart-disease/data)

**Description**:
A classic dataset used to predict the presence of **heart disease** based on diagnostic test results and patient attributes.

**Key Features**:

* `Age`, `Sex`
* `Chest pain type`
* `Resting blood pressure`, `Cholesterol`
* `Maximum heart rate`, `Exercise-induced angina`
* `ST depression`, `Slope of peak exercise ST segment`
* `Target`: 1 (disease present) or 0 (no disease)

**Use Case**:

* Binary classification model for **cardiac risk prediction**
* Useful in emergency triage and preventive cardiology decision support

### ü©∫ 2. [Diabetes Dataset ‚Äì Multi-Type View](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitbatra1210/diabetes-dataset/data)

**Description**:
This dataset provides an extensive overview of various types of **diabetes**, including:

* Steroid-Induced Diabetes
* Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM)
* Prediabetes
* Type 1 Diabetes
* Wolfram Syndrome

It combines **medical**, **genetic**, and **lifestyle attributes** to provide a holistic view of diabetes pathophysiology and risk.

**Key Features**:

* **Target**: Type of diabetes or prediabetic condition
* **Genetic Markers**: Indicators of genetic predisposition
* **Autoantibodies**: Biomarkers for autoimmune diabetes
* **Family History**: Genetic risk indicators
* **Environmental Factors**: Contextual contributors to disease onset
* **Insulin Levels**: Metabolic profiling
* **Demographics**: Age, BMI
* **Lifestyle**: Physical activity and dietary habits

**Use Case**:

* Multi-class classification model to distinguish between **types of diabetes**
* Foundation for personalized diabetes care and genetic screening tools

### üß¨ 3. [Multi-Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/obulisainaren/multi-cancer/data)

**Description**:
Contains anonymized patient records representing multiple cancer types (e.g., **breast, lung, colon**), potentially along with tumor staging, biomarkers, or therapy metadata.

**Key Features** (based on inferred schema):

* Cancer type classification
* Tumor staging & grade
* Clinical attributes: gender, age
* Genomic or pathology data (if included)

**Use Case**:

* Train **multi-class classifiers** to predict cancer types
* Enhance oncology workflows or build models for **personalized treatment recommendations**

### üß† 4. [PMC Patients Dataset for Clinical Decision Support](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/priyamchoksi/pmc-patients-dataset-for-clinical-decision-support/data)

**Description**:
A synthetic yet realistic dataset designed to simulate **real-world clinical decision-making**. It includes a broad array of features useful for differential diagnosis, medication selection, and personalized treatment.

**Key Features**:

* **Symptoms & History**: Chief complaints, medical history
* **Lab Results & Vitals**: Bloodwork, vitals, and diagnostic tests
* **Medications & Allergies**: Current prescriptions and drug interactions
* **Clinical Outcomes**: Recovery status, readmission, etc.
* **Decision Support Tags**: Optional indicators for decision paths

**Use Case**:

* Build end-to-end **Agentic AI systems** that mimic clinician workflows
* Use in LLM-based CDSS agents for triage, diagnosis, and treatment suggestion
